# Quantum Circuit Construction for TSP

# Import necessary libraries
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_multivector, plot_histogram

# Define the number of cities
num_cities = 4

# Create a quantum circuit with the required number of qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(num_cities)

# Apply the mixing Hamiltonian gates
for i in range(num_cities):
    qc.h(i)

# Apply the cost Hamiltonian gates
# Encode the objective function of the TSP

# Measure the qubits to obtain the final solution
qc.measure_all()

# Visualize the circuit
qc.draw()
